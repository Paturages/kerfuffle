# /r/visualnovels Battle Royale

[Demo](http://fightthe.pw/kerfuffle)

A *Dies Irae* /r/visualnovels contest entry.  

Basically a very basic proof-of-concept *Disgaea/Fire Emblem/Dofus*-like game featuring visual novel characters. Made from scratch in Inferno (a React-like view library) in ~10-15 hours of actual work.  

I probably put way too much effort into it, but this was fun to do and let me explore the possibilities of inplementing a game engine and UI in a React-like environment!

# Development

Latest node version (>= v8) is recommended. `npm install`, then `npm start` should open a browser page to `http://localhost:8080`.

# TODO (and will probably never be done)
(more of a *what if I had more time* list of features)

* Add loss condition (HP == 0) (*Yep. Characters basically can't die in the current version*)
* Add win condition (Everyone has lost)
* Add abilities, with range and effects
* Add ultimate abilities
* Add ability/ultimate dialogs
* Add music
* Add music change on ultimate
* Add basic AI
* Add attack/ability/ultimate custom animations
* Make music loop seamlessly
* Add SFX
* Add short voice lines
* Add random background changes
* Improve music quality
